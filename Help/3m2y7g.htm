An Association refers to a file type and an application. For instance files that end with the extension .DOC are generally Microsoft Word document files. Files of this type and the application that creates them are associated within the operating system. This means that when you open a file with the .DOC extension the file is opened in Word. Similarly a picture file with the extension .BMP will be opened in a graphics application.
<br>
Ameol uses these associations when decoding attached files. When decoded, an attached file will be shown in the message as an icon for the associated application. This means that if you are send a Word document as an attached file to an e-mail message, when decoded this file will be shown as the icon for Microsoft Word with the name of the file underneath. Double clicking this icon will open the attached file in Microsoft Word.
<br>
Ameol also associates file types with directories. When you download files, by default Ameol will save them in the Download directory. However, by selecting the Associations command from the Settings menu you can set Ameol to download different file types into different directories.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
