A forum is a subject area within CIX Forums where messages are posted which can be read by all members of the forum. CIX Forums exist in three forms - open (anybody can join), closed (forum will be listed but you can only be joined by a moderator) and closed confidential (not listed). 
<br>

<br>
There are lots of forums on CIX Forums covering all manner of subjects and each of these is overseen by a moderator. A CIX forum can also hold files that can be downloaded by members of the forum.
<br>
