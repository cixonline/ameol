<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">This option allows you to control how email replies are threaded. With the option on, Ameol will attempt to thread using the subject line if there is no other way to thread the messages, with the option off Ameol will not attempt to thread by subject. Threading by subject can be useful if you frequently correspond with someone who uses a non-threading mail program.
