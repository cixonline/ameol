When you select this script to be added to the Out Basket you will be asked to provide your current password. Next you will be asked to enter your new password twice. Ameol does not check that the new passwords match, but the CIX system does. If your new passwords do not match your password will remain unchanged.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
