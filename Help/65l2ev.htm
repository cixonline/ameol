Here are the Top 20 Frequently Asked Questions about Ameol:
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>1. How do I get rid of the logo on each topic on the in-basket?</b>
<br>

<br>
Select this from your menu - Settings | Preferences | Viewer | Display and make sure that "Show folder type in In Basket" is not selected.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>2. Where has the Utilities menu gone - I can't find my addons?</b>
<br>

<br>
Addons are now embedded into the Ameol menu system. If an addon deals with mail, for example, you'll find a menu item for it under the Mail menu dropdown. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>3. I can't find CIXBill, though I know it's loaded.</b>
<br>

<br>
You'll find it in the File menu - listed as CIX Billing. Make sure that the version of CIXBill you have is at least version 3.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>4. Why is ShowConf on the Settings menu?</b>
<br>

<br>
That's the way it was written by the author.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>5. What do the three symbols next to the signature box on the Mail Message window actually do?</b>
<br>

<br>
The red "up" triangle raises the priority of your mail. The black "down" triangle lowers the priority of your mail.
<br>
Some email programs handle prioritised mail differently - for example, displaying high priority mail first.
<br>

<br>
The CC button is selected (turned on/pushed in) by default. This will make Ameol send a copy of the mail back to yourself. This is useful as confirmation that your mail was actually sent. Turning this off is not a good idea unless you don't care about tracking your mail.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>6. Where has the terminal window gone?
<br>
</b>
<br>
You need to make sure this is turned on if you want to see it. It's turned on as default, but perhaps you've disabled it by accident - re-enable it. Do this by selecting Settings | Forums... and making sure you have selected the option Display terminal window while blinking to CIX.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>7. Why doesn't the toolbar float any more?</b>
<br>
Ameol was written using newer display controls, which although allow the program to do much more, does not allow a floating toolbar.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>8. I've closed my in/out basket and it's gone! (not on Window menu)</b>
<br>

<br>
If you want your basket back, select View, and then select In Basket or Out Basket - the window will reappear.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>9. I installed Ameol for CIX Forums only, how do I add Internet options?
<br>
</b>
<br>
You'll need to click on the Ameol Setup icon in your CIX Software Program Manager
<br>
or Start Menu group and enter your account details.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>10. What do the username/realname things mean in the install wizard?
<br>
</b>
<br>
Your username relates to your hostname, so use that. Your realname is just that - your real name (e.g. Paul Wakeford, or
<br>
Graham Freeman). The real name is displayed in header of your emails and your Usenet postings.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>11. How do I add a spacer between toolbar buttons?
<br>
</b>
<br>
Select Settings | Toolbar. Now move the button to the right of where you want the space to be, to the right. Move it about one third of it's width. You'll see a space appear between the two buttons.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>12. Do I have to have an Internet account to use Ameol?</b>
<br>

<br>
No, but you'll not be using all the facilities of Ameol if you don't. For more information on how an Internet account can benefit you, please mail sales@cix.co.uk
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>13. The meaning of Reply-To: on the mail form</b>
<br>

<br>
When you send mail, the recipient will need to know where to send their reply. The "Reply-To:" field contains the address to which their email will be sent if they wish to reply to your mails. It's generally a good idea to set this to the email address you give out to people as your own.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>14. I only want to pick up my CIX Forums messages, what do I do?
<br>
</b>
<br>
Select File | Send & Receive... | CIX Forums Only...
<br>

<br>
You can put a button on the toolbar for this by selecting Settings | Toolbar | Blinks.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>15. I want to filter incoming email, what do I do?</b>
<br>

<br>
Display one of the messages that you wish to base your sort criteria on, and then from the menu select Mail. In the dropdown list, you'll see Sort Mail From and Sort Mail To ... Select the one you wish to base your filter on, and then choose the folder into which the mail should be filtered.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>16. I want my mail from CIX Internet but news from another provider, what do I do?</b>
<br>

<br>
When you subscribe to a new newsgroup by selecting News | Subscribe, you need to type in the name of the group. Notice at the bottom of this box is the name of the news server to get the news from. The default is from CIX Internet, but you can select another server. If your preferred server isn't in the list, add it by clicking the New Server button and filing in the details for it.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>17. How do I password protect my Ameol database?</b>
<br>

<br>
Select the Users item on the Settings menu. Highlight the name of the user to which password protection will be applied. Click the Edit button and enter the password into the Password box.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>18. What Ameol addons are there and how do I configure them?</b>
<br>

<br>
There is a full list of addons available from the ameolnews forum. This list is being added to all the time, but at the time of writing it includes:
<br>

<br>
CIXBill  - Gets billing information
<br>
ShowConf - Displays forum info (including the moderators of closed forums).
<br>
TopicInf - Displays information about who posts in topics.
<br>
GetMM    - Grabs missing messages from CIX Forums, to fill any holes.
<br>
Moderate - Allows you to run your own forum.
<br>
AMEdit   - Access your connect log/profile, from within Ameol.
<br>
OBRec    - Recovers your outbasket in the event of a failed connect.
<br>
IOBask   - Holds details of your mail stored on CIX Forums.
<br>
Acronyms - Decodes those pesky acronyms.
<br>

<br>
The addons can be configured by selecting them from the menu bar.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>19. What's the best way to report a problem?
<br>
</b>
<br>
Click Help | Submit Report. This will ask you a few questions about your problem and then send the report to us in the manner most suitable for your installation.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>20. How to I order the folders in the In Basket?
<br>
</b>
<br>
 Imagine your In Basket (the big "proper" one, not the small one attached to the message window) is like this:
<br>

<br>
- folder 1
<br>
 \topic
<br>
 \topic
<br>
 \topic
<br>
 
<br>
- folder 2
<br>
 \topic
<br>
 
<br>
- folder 3
<br>
 \topic
<br>
 \topic
<br>
 
<br>
- folder 4
<br>
 \topic
<br>
 
<br>
 
<br>
Now you want to move folder 4 so it is between folder 2 and folder 3. 
<br>

<br>
Pick up folder 4 with your mouse and drop it on folder 2, *not* on folder 3 or on the topic(s) between folders 2 and 3. When dragging and dropping folders the folder will always end up underneath the folder you drop onto. If you try to drop a folder onto a topic you will be told that this is not possible.
