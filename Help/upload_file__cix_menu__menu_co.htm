<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">This menu command opens the <a href=idsful.htm>Upload File Dialog Box</a> which allows you to upload a file to the currently highlighted CIX forum. Bear in mind that not every CIX forum has a file list attached.

<b>Note:</b> This command allows you to upload a file to a CIX Forum and should not be confused with the Upload File command in the Mail Menu which will upload a file to your CIX Mail Directory.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
