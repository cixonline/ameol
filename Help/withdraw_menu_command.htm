<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">This menu command will allow you to withdraw a CIX forum message or Usenet newsgroup article. A CIX Forums message will be withdrawn the next time that Ameol connects to CIX Forums. Withdrawing newsgroup articles is less straightforward because the message that Ameol sends to withdraw your article has to follow the article around the Internet. Note that the copy of the message within your database will not be deleted but will be marked with a `W'.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
