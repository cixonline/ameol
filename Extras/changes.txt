2.20

1. Ported to Visual C++ Express 2005.
2. Renamed "Conferences" to "Forums" in the UI strings.

2.11

1. Fixed GPF exporting non-flisted files from fdir to filepool
2. Fixed GPF setting read-only status on invalid/deleted topics
3. Made Mail message windows wrap text.

Beta 15

1.  Fixed Y2K issue with file dates greater than 1999.
2.  Fixed GPF deleting fdir entries.
3.  Read Only Topics should now maintain their state 
    after purging.
4.  Fixed GPF when creating a new conference and changing 
    the names of topics.

Beta 14

1.  Fixed problem with OS & Status notify option not sticking.
2.  Prompt / Multiple / Single message notification is now 
    settable via the setup dialog.
3.  Fixed mouse highlighting problem, when multiple items 
    were selected.
4.  Added description to fexport mail message for the file 
    pool mods.
5.  The fexport mail is now not generated within the filepool
    conference.

Beta 12

1.  Made adding software status and O/S to notification message 
    optional.
2.  Fixed focus problem with main and notification dialogs.
3.  Turned off word wrap in the notification dialog.
4.  The RMB text now toggles Hold and Release depending on item 
    state. (and Hold/Release for multiple selections).
5.  Fixed highlight problem during spell checks.
6.  Added minimal support for mail notifications of filepool 
    exports.
7.  Fixed Copy/Past problem with Ameol 1.x.

Beta 11.

1.  Changed so that Conf / Edit File List is always enabled. If you 
    select it in a topic you don't moderate, it will popup the list 
	of available topics.
2.  Added some toolbar bitmaps for Help/About and Help/Contents for 
    Moderate.
3.  Fixed problem with exporting multiple files to filepool, skipping 
    files.
4.  Added Status and O/S to flist Notification fields, left blank for
    the moderator to fill in (or delete).
5.  Re-Enabled code to toggle topic read only/read write status.
6.  Moved Moderate Setup dialog to the configure addon dialog. (though 
    this does add 3 extra pages, I think it fits in quite well...)

Beta 10.

1. Changed topic read only status code, to revert to the previous
   version. This is done to confirm this was the cause of a pre-blink
   GPF.
2. Hopefully fixed problem with topic size updating code.
3. Moderate now includes the WinHorus and HCTools support addons 
   within the main program.
4. Fixed GPF closing the dialog with Escape.


Beta 9.

1. Changed the read only/write update code slightly for when topic information 
   is re-freshed, but I doubt it will stop the extra updates.

2. Set statistics dialog controls to hidden.

3. Changed the logic of spell checking notification messages, so you shouldn't
   have to press finish twice.

4. Implemented new setup program.

5. Extended file name length to 14 characters in filepool / mail notification 
   dialog.

Beta 8.

1. Final attempt to fix the script problems. I've reverted to the original 
   method of switching the read only status, on reflectionseemed a bit stilly 
   to use the new method on a newly created conference.

2. Changed drag behaviour so that unless you've pre-highlighted the line you
   want to drag, it behaves as a normal listbox.

3. Changed drag cursor logic, so it changed to the no drop cursor when not 
   within the listbox window when dragging.
   
Beta 7.

1. Another attempt to fix the script problems.

Beta 6.

1. Fixed problem with toggling conference Read Only status.
2. Changed read only toggle to only activate if status has actually changed (oops :)).
3. Adjusted edit buffer on flist descriptions to 1024 bytes, compared to 512,
   and added checks so this can't be over flowed and cause GPF.

Beta 5.

1. Added Script items to not toggle but set topic read only/read write status.
2. Changed notification window description back to having the description on 
   it's own line.
3. Removed Cancel from delete flist entry query dialog.
4. Fixed problem with new Topic Notification routine (Modal Dialog) 
   calling the MDI message editor routine.
5. Now 'optionally' saves the last upload directory.
6. Added query cancel dialog to notification edit window.
7. Completed 16bit port.

Beta 4.

1. The only change in this version is it (hopefully) cures the
   layout problem using large fonts.

Beta 3.

1. Re-worked dialog creation routine, might cure scaling problem.
2. Changed page switching code to move the controls when created, this is
   slightly slower than the previous method, but gets rid of the 'ghost' 
   dialog that used to come up when you changed pages.
3. Fixes problem deliberately creating duplicate flist entries.
4. Changed the notification dialog to be MDI (sort of a cut down Say
   window, but still has things like auto-spell check).
5. Fixed help button not working in main dialog (though I've just noticed 
   it doesn't work in this dialog).
6. Added drag capability in Flist window, so you can move items up and down
   with the mouse (I was looking at doing it between flist windows, but
   that turned out to be a lot more complicated).
7. Del key in flist dialog now deletes items.
8. Ins key in flist dialog inserts blank line.
9. Fixed focus problem after adding an Flist entry (i.e. so that notify was
   greyed out even thought an item in the flist was highlighted).

To Do:

1. Allow different signatures to be selected.
2. Add query/cancel to notify dialog.
3. Discover why sort flist doesn't work (did it before I started messing
   with it?).
4. Adjust layout slightly so buttons down RHS match up on both pages.

Beta 2.

1. Fixed problem cancelling the dialog creation.
2. You can now open more than one Moderate window at a time (this is 
   quite cool, but I keep wanting to drag'n'drop files).
3. Changed the Query save dialog to not have a cancel button if Ameol2 
   is quitting (it did GPF if you tries this).

Beta 1.

1. Changed main dialog code to be MDI.
