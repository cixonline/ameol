<br>

<br>

<br>
The message window is composed of three panes.
<br>

<br>
The <b>message pane</b> displays the text of the current message. When there are more lines of text than will fit on the screen you will see a vertical scroll bar. Use the Page Down key to see the rest of the text.
<br>

<br>
The <b>thread pane</b> displays the current thread of messages in the topic. You can add and remove columns from the thread window by selecting Show Columns from the View menu. You can change the columns displayed <b>individually </b>(just for the current topic, the default) or <b>globally</b> by holding down the Control key before selecting <b>Show Columns</b> from the <a href=ind5z1o5r.htm>View Menu</a>. Columns that can be added include the date, size of message (in kilobytes for mail and forum messages, or number of lines for usenet messages), or you can remove any of the three standard columns (number, name and subject).
<br>

<br>
To change the column widths click on the vertical column dividers, hold down the mouse button and move the mouse left or right to resize the column. By default this will only change the column width for the current topic, to make the adjustment apply to all topics hold down the control key before making the adjustment.
<br>

<br>
You can also select how messages are sorted. By default messages are sorted by <b>reference</b>, which means that a "tree" of messages is built up as new commented are added to the topic. Reference order is shown in the illustration above. Messages can also be sorted by <b>number</b>, <b>name</b> or <b>subject</b> by holding down shift and clicking on the grey column headers at the top of the thread pane. If you sort by anything other than reference a small indicator as shown as shown below is displayed in the relevant column. You can also change the sort order by selecting <b>Sorted By</b> from the <a href=ind5z1o5r.htm>View Menu</a>.
<br>

<br>

<br>
There is also an <b>in basket pane</b> (if this is not visible it can be made visible by holding down shift and double-clicking the grey vertical bar to the left of the number column). This is a smaller version of the <a href=ind89cxik.htm>In Basket</a> window. 
<br>

<br>
Various actions can be performed on the message by selecting a command from the <a href=h7k5pd.htm>Message Menu</a>.
<br>

<br>
You may also see text highlighted in red in the message window. These are <a href=con4f60ta.htm>Hot Links</a>. When you see these in an Ameol message you can click on them to go to that message or URL. If you would like to open a new window and go to the specified message, hold down the Control key before clicking on the link.
<br>

<br>
Message styles turn words or phrases surrounded by *asterisks* into <b>bold</b>, those surrounded by _underscores_ underlined and those surrounded by /slashes/ <i>italicised</i>. This behaviour is controlled by the Message Styles command on the <a href=ind5z1o5r.htm>View</a> menu.
