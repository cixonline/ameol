You will be asked to provide the name of the ftp site where the file can be found, the path of the directory in which it can be found and the name of the file. Your request will be added to a queue and you will receive the file via e-mail when your request has reached the top of the queue.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
