This is a Hot Spot image. Move your mouse pointer over the image
<br>
and when the mouse pointer changes to the shape of a hand click
<br>
the left mouse button once for extra help.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Enter the e-mail address of the recipient of the message in the <b>To</b> text box. You can copy your message to other addresses by entering them in the <b>CC</b> text box, or send them privately using the BCC text box. When entering multiple addresses be sure to leave a space between each address. You can choose the addresses to go in either of these text boxes from the Address Book by clicking the <b>To,</b>  <b>CC</b> or <b>BCC</b> buttons.
<br>

<br>
Select the address that you would like replies sent to in the <b>Reply To</b> list box. One Reply To address is kept for each mailbox, or you can choose your default Reply To address. Reply-To addresses are only acted upon when the mail is sent via an Internet mail server. If your mail is being sent through CIX, the Reply-To address will be set to your email address.
<br>

<br>
Enter the title of your message in the <b>Subject</b> text box. 
<br>

<br>
Press Control-Q to quote the original message in the message editor. Try not to quote too much of the original message - as a general rule the amount of new text typed by you should exceed the amount of quoted text. You can read about other keyboard shortcuts <a href=key6ooe_f.htm>here</a>.
<br>

<br>
If you want to attach an encoded file to your message, locate the file by clicking the <b>Attachment</b> button or enter the name and location of the file in the <b>Attachment</b> text box. You can attach more than one file to a message but must type the path/names of any files after the first one by hand. Separate the filenames with a space, and remember to put quotation marks around any files that contain spaces in their name or path. After adding an attachment you can select the method of encoding from the list that will appear next to the <b>Attachment</b> text box.
<br>

<br>
The two buttons with arrows allow you to assign a <b>priority </b>to the message. The up arrow will mark your message high priority, the down arrow low. You should bear in mind that not all mail reading software will recognise the priority of an e-mail message.
<br>

<br>
The <b>CC </b>button allows you to select whether you keep a copy of this email message. By default this button is depressed meaning that you do get a copy of all of your outgoing messages.
<br>

<br>
You will see the chain symbol button if this e-mail message is in reply to an e-mail message that you have received. If you click this button, the text of the original message will be appended to your reply.
<br>

<br>
The RR (Return Receipt) button requests a message back from the addressees' mail software when your message has been read. Not all mail software supports this feature.
<br>

<br>
Now enter the your message in the main part of the dialog box. You can add a signature to the end of your message by choosing one from the <b>Signature</b> list.
<br>

<br>
Click the <b>Save</b> button to send your message the next time Ameol blinks.
