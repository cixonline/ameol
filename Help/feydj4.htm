<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">This CIX Forums script will reset your CIX Forums pointers back a specified number of days. Your pointers are the settings on CIX Forums that tell the CIX system which forums you are joined to and which messages you have read. CIX pointers are saved around midnight each day so if you reset your pointers for today use the <b>Restore pointers </b>script. You will be asked to specify the number of days that you need your pointers to go back. Note that if you have joined or resigned any forums since your pointers were set you will lose these settings.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
