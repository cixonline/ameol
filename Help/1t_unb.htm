<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">This CIX script will show you the contents of an archive (.ZIP or .ARC) file on the CIX Forums system. The list of files contained in the archive file will be saved to a file called FAT.TXT in your \download directory in your Ameol setup. You will be asked to choose the forum and topic where the archive file can be found from a list that resembles that found in the In Basket. You will also need to specify the name of the archive file.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
