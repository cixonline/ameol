<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">This CIX Forums script will reset your CIX Forums pointers back to how they were set this morning. Your pointers are the settings on CIX Forums that tell the CIX system which forums you are joined to and which messages you have read. CIX pointers are saved around midnight each day. Note that if you have joined or resigned any forums since your pointers were set you will lose these settings.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
