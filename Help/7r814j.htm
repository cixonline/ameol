<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">This script will give you a complete and up-to-date list of the forums in which you are currently a participant on CIX Forums. The script will go to every topic in every forum that you are joined to and mark at least one message as unread. When you next blink with Ameol you will retrieve these messages and in this way build up a complete list of every forum and topic. Before running this script you should ensure that your Timeout value for the blink item you are using is set to at least 300 seconds as no information will be received by Ameol while this script is running.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
