<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">Enter any e-mail addresses that you would like your message copied to in here. You can either type the addresses in directly, leaving a space between separate addresses, or click the <b>BCC:</b> button to choose the addresses from the <a href=dodak.htm>Address Book</a>. Unlike CC, BBC addresses are not listed in the email header so the other addressees do not know that the message has been sent to any of the addresses listed in the BCC field.
