The Erase Mail File dialog box allows you to delete a file that is held in your Mail directory on CIX Forums. 
<br>

<br>
You can choose the file to delete by clicking the <b>Filename</b> button or by entering the name in the <b>Erase File</b> text box. The list of files in you mail directory will only be as up-to-date as the last time you retrieved in from CIX Forums. If the file you were expecting to find is not in the list or if the Filename button is not visible click the <b>Update</b> button on the <a href=ind_hclkj.htm>Mail Directory</a> dialog.
<br>

<br>
Once you click <b>OK</b> an item will be added to the Out Basket and the file will be deleted the next time that Ameol connects to CIX Forums. You should be aware that once this file has been deleted it cannot be recovered. If you have sent the file to another user then deleting it from your mail directory does not delete it from their mail directory.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
