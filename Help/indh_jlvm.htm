Pointers (in the context of CIX Forums) is the set of data that CIX Forums hold that tells it which forums you are joined to and which messages you have read.
<br>

<br>
Pointers are set at just after midnight every day, so if you use the Reset Pointers script you will return to the state that was set for you this morning. Resetting Pointers can be useful if you lose some forum messages from your message database and wish to download them again.
<br>

<br>
You should note that the CIX Pointers also contain information about the forums you are joined to. If you join a forum and then reset your pointers, you will no longer be joined to that forum.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
