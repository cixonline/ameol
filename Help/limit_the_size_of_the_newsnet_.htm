Since busy newsgroups can lead to very large downloads, this is a useful feature if you want to restrict download times. Note that this restriction will only apply to newsgroup articles retrieved via CIX Forums. It is not possible to restrict downloads through an Internet service.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
