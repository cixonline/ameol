The file will be saved as profile.txt in your download directory. You can edit this file using any text editor but you must save it in plain ASCII format. Before adding any commands to it, try them out first to check that they do what you expected. You should also avoid any commands that require user input. Upload your edited profile by using the <b>Put profile.txt</b> script.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
