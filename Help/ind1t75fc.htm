You will be asked to provide the name the site that the file can be found on, the directory in which it can be found, and the name(s) of the file(s) that you wish to download. You can enter multiple filenames by putting a space between the names. The file(s) will be downloaded via CIX Forums and then downloaded to your computer.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
