The FILESTATS command gives a list of the files in a topic and how many times they've been downloaded since a given date. You will be asked to choose the name of the forum topic from the list of forums as it appears in the In Basket. You will also be asked to specify a filename into which the results will be saved.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:11pt; color:#000000">
